				<h2>Why visit Lisbon?</h2>
				<p>Lisbon is a fascinating city full of history, monuments, impressive bridges and vintage street cars. And these are just a few of the reasons that make it an extremely interesting city to visit and a place you will want to return to.

In 2016, Lisbon was ranked number 7 in the top ten European cities to visit. Its cheap flights, relative closeness to major capital cities like Madrid, Paris and London, make it an ideal destination for a weekend break.

Visiting Lisbon is relatively inexpensive and you can find low-cost flights from the UK for just £30 ($36, 34€) and hotels from £55 ($78, 65€).</p>


				<h2>Where do I begin?</h2>

				<p>If you’ve never been to Lisbon before, we recommend you read about its history followed by its neighbourhoods and its top attractions. If you are only in Lisbon for two days, check out our 2-day Itinerary of the city.

				<h2>Need accommodation?</h2>
