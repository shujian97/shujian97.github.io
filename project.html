<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>Given topic about food for expats was very interesting because expats are everywhere and everyone can be an expat. We had a brainstorming session to perform an interview with five different people and tried to find people’s needs. The results were more complicated than we expected. People cared about various aspects in terms of food consumption. They considered price, taste, health, time, convenience (e.g. delivery service), food advice or recommendation service, and etc. One of the interview results we focused is the fact that people love organic food. People did not just buy cheap food, but they took the food quality into consideration as well.

Demands for organic food have been constantly increasing [1]. Many grocery markets are promoting fresh foods which do not contain chemical components and the interest of health among consumers are increasing everyday. As a solution of pursuing organic food, many people started to grow their own vegetables and fruits in their home. However, it is not easy for the expats to grow food since mostly they don’t have their own garden.  Therefore, based on the interview results and some more discussions with tutor, we came up with Ginger, a shared garden service for expats. 

Ginger is a mobile platform where users can borrow a small space in a shared garden and grow their own organic food. Through our mobile application, users can get everything they need to know for gardening and harvest their food. First, users can rent their own garden space in our property. By tracking user’s location, Ginger recommends users an optimized garden based on their preferences. Second, our application provides detailed instructions of how to grow crops with video and text manual. More detailed information such as total progress, daily tasks, and weather stats can be accessed in a dashboard page. Third, expats are able to have more opportunities to interact with local community by joining a group project and socialize with local people by growing crops together. Users can also join a forum page where they can post questions and get some answers from other users or experts.This function will connect more people with each other and help them build better and safer society. 

 A detailed description of our Ginger platform including paper prototype, digital prototype and their usability test results will be presented here <p>
  
<h2>Prototype Explanation</h2>
<p>Now that we have defined our target user groups’ main problem, for this section we dive in and explain the details of our solution--the function.

Figure 1 main functions of Ginger

To illustrate this product‘s function, first we need to go through our goals. Speaking of what we would like to provide for our expats, we concern most about chances to physically grow their own crops. Another important thing is to build a deeper connection with their communities. Based on these goals, we made a lot of choices, such as giving up a solution that focuses on the organic food market because it is a bit too far away from the topic. In the end, we selected this solution to best balance our two initial goals.

The functions of Ginger can be divided into three different service we want to provide. As the picture shows, the three of them are knowledge, project and community, among which project is the most important one.  Our application is designed around the user's planting project, all for the accomplishment and convenience of planting plants. The other two parts of functions also serves the main one. The knowledge part - gardening library - allow users to have access to all kinds of tutorials they want, which prepare them for real gardening and raise interest. For the community section, it helps to retain users and increase the frequency of their use.

Now we go through the detailed description of each function section in turn. 

First, the gardening library is intended to be a resource for users. It would be placed in an easy-to-approach position so that users can check it anytime. In this library, knowledge in forms of articles, videos, images or sound track will be classified into clear subjects about gardening such as plants, soil, fertilizer, tools and so on. The developers, which is us, will provide the initial framework and enough authoritative information, yet we also open the gate for users to create their content and contribute to the library, just like Wikipedia.

As for the second part, there are more complex segmentation features about projects. According to the timeline of gardening process, there are three stages: creating a project, managing a project, and completing a project. To create a project, the users would make a series of decisions: which plant and where to grow, whether do it alone or join a group. After all the settings, they are able to find the rented share garden following guidance on our app and prepare tools, seeds also with help from our app. After they begin the project, they could view dashboard of their current project and monitor all data of their crop. There is also a daily to-do list for the individuals or group members to manage and trace the growth. For groups, there is also a chat function in the community section so that they could easily communicate. Then for the stage of harvest, the project system will send notifications to remind users and offer a complete tutorial for harvesting different crops. It is worth mentioning that advanced image recognition technology could tell when the crops can be harvested just by scanning a photo the user takes of it.

Last but not least, the community section focus on creating real bound with local residents. There are simply two forms of community: forum and chats. The forum is more like Instagram that users just posts everything about their plants while chats provide the platform to manage group projects and also deal with conversations between friends. Another thing noteworthy is that users are able to connect with others both offline and online: by scanning a unique QR code matched to one project in the garden, you can interact with the owner of that one, so this is a great opportunity to find your neighbors.</p>


<h2>Paper Prototype </h2>

<p>Sketching was a key step in the design process. It made the communication of design a faster and more effective process. We followed some of the techniques proposed in The Workbook: Sketching User Experiences [4]. Some pictures of the paper prototype are listed below. 

                Figure 1. Paper Prototype	

Figure 1. shows all the pages we draw in this part. We draw about 20 pages in the first time. Then we figure out we need more pages to solve the problem we state before. Therefore, we draw 30 paper prototype to finish this whole process.
	  

             Figure 2. Paper Prototype	
Figure 2. shows some main pages of this product. There are 5 main menus in the bar below. They are home, library, mission, forum and personal page. The following pages are the process of one user start his own project. Step one is to find a partner or not. Step two is to choose your plant. Step three is to choose your garden. Step four is to write some plant profile to attract other user to join in and the final step is congratulations.
  

Figure 3. Paper Prototype

Figure 3. gives some detailed page of each menu. People can know more information about their plants after they click the button in the first page. They can find groups to join and see the detailed information of the group. User can also ask questions in our forum and make friends there.


Figure 4. Paper Prototype
Figure 4. shows some detailed pages in personal page. People can check their profile in experience and wishlist. The rest two pages will be shown when people have grown their plants already. The product will ask our users to give some reviews on the process of their planting.</p>


<h2>Paper prototype usability Test</h2>

<p>Test method: We have chosen Concurrent Think Aloud (CTA) and Retrospective Probing (RP) methods [2].

We have shown our paper prototype to our subjects, and ask them to “use” our product while we are directing interactive pages to them. We recorded what they did and what they said while they were discovering our product.

Summary of usability test result:
1 subject first tapped recommended items and created his own project well in general. 2 was confused on a few buttons. 3 skipped introduction and bottom buttons. 1 was worried about to be binded with new people. Prefered doing alone. 1 wants to visit the garden first. 1 wonders details information of each garden. 

Suggestions from our subjects:

We should give more details of the land(map), materials for garden, transportation information, and costs.
“Go back” and “Next” buttons are missing. Details info of each garden should be added.
He likes to make an appointment to go and see the plant and meet the gardeners .
This subject only uses very little of our app. For users who want to do projects alone, the information or help that our app provides seems very insufficient. They need other methods to get involved with community(which is our goal), so we should create some social functions with less stress and more quiet, such as complimenting the plants growing next to your garden by scanning a QR code beside it.
User didn’t recognize ‘video play button’. He didn’t recognize that one is a button. We might need some description for the button. He also wondered offline shops where he can buy seeds and tools for garden. 
User did not understand the congratulations page right away. Maybe we should have said, you  created a project ! User needs a description or a list of what is each video 1,2,3,4,5 not only after watching the video, but as a todo list instead of a checkbox.
User mentioned that the video needs more text description or details. He thought he could find some other information except the tutorial video in the tutorial pages. 
we should add that while you create your project you can set it to either private or public, a link directly to text based tutorials rather than videos in the tutorials video page
it does not appear obvious that the tutorial is on going for the whole project , give information that each video is one step in the process , remove the finish button and put something to communicate this is an ongoing progress that you have to go to the garden and perform yourself , he did not specify how large the growing area would be 
in experience we should list other people’s public projects , cannot see other people current project.
May be the text of the video should not be in that video but in the tutorials videos only
you should know what you need to get started, may be near the tutorials page which indicates it's progress, it should tell you in each step what you need to buy.

Improvements after usability testing:
After the first use, the “introduction” section of home page will be replaced by a dashboard showing the on-going project. We also add the function of monitoring the whole gardening process(despite how difficult it is to implement it) by showing data collected from it, thus our users can get real help from us and use our app more frequently.
We redo the user flow of creating a new project in different context and modify the steps.
We add go-back and next button in process page to help user continue.
We do some adjustments to our paper prototype to optimized information architecture.</p>
<h2>Digital Prototype</h2>

<p>We used Sketch App to create the digital prototype. Once we had a first working version of the prototype and the approval from the tutor, we did the usability test with the same user group from the paper usability test. Some screenshots of the digital prototype are listed below.

Usability Tests
The techniques for the digital prototype testing are Concurrent Think Aloud (CTA) and Retrospective Probing (RP) [2]. We gave our subjects a set of tasks to do in order to traverse all the functionalities of our application. The tasks list is as follows:
Start a project alone
Start a project by starting a group
Start a project by joining a group
Start chatting
Check their profiles
Go to chat and to forum community
Watch introduction video
Go to current project
Complete a task in to-do list 

Summary of usability test results for each task (4 subjects)
Start a project alone:
One user wants to be able to scroll in digital prototype, they want to click something else than banana. 
Two subjects think that creating a project alone was not difficult. They did not understand what the heart button is for. In fact, it is a button to add current product to wishlist.
Start a project by starting a group: 
Two subjects pointed out there is no option to invite a friend while starting a group.
Start a project by joining a group:
Two subjects think it’s too stupid that they need to choose product first when he wants to join a group. Three subjects needs to see the participants in a group inside a project. Three subjects wants to know the location of this group project.
Start chatting: 
All subjects thinks It is very easy to find chatting page.
Check their profiles: 
All subjects thinks It is very easy to check.
Go to chat and forum community: 
All subjects thinks it is very easy.
Watch introduction video: 
All subjects thinks it is very easy.
Go to current project: 
All subjects thinks it is very easy.
One subject wants to watch the tutorial videos for current project.
Two subjects want to make their projects private/public and recognize which projects are group projects or individual projects.
Three subjects think the icon of “quick go to current project” is not clear enough. 
Complete a task in todo list: 
All subjects could find the todo list is very easy to use. 
Suggestions from our subjects:
One subject suggests us to change the icon of todo list to mailbox like notifications, or reminders.
One subject suggests us to make our icons more stylish and unique, and animation for actions in todo list are suggested. 
One subject said he is not a fan of video tutorials, after a short video he expects more text for the instructions instead of a video.
One subject said after creating project, he wanted to see specific instruction instead of dashboard (only if this is his first time to create a project). 
One subject  wants to see current project dashboard on the home page  If he already has current project active. 

Improvements after usability testing: 
We improved and completed our digital prototype based on those testing results.
In an existing group project, We added more information like location and members.
Tutorial videos/ Instructions are added in current project page.
Edit button has been added onto profile page.
Product is not needed to be chosen again when users come from “start” on product page for all “Do it alone”, “New group project” and “Joining an existing group” pages.
Invitation function is added onto creating project page.
Mission assigning features are added in todo list.
Scrolling functions are added for all necessary pages.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We proposed home gardening service for people who don’t have their own garden but have passion of growing organic food. Based on potential customer interview result, we came up with this idea and developed paper prototype by hand sketch. Usability test was performed by using Concurrent Think Aloud (CTA) and Retrospective Probing (RP) methods [2]. Furthermore, we made digital prototype and updated it according to our second usability test. We confirmed that the usability testing is a good tool to improve our prototype in a more human-centered way.
