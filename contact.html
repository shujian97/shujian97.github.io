				<h2>Beyond conventional interaction patterns</h2>
				<p>I’m Johny Vino, an energetic designer who combines rapid prototyping, interaction, motion, and visual design to transform thorny problems into elegant solutions.

My work goes beyond conventional interaction patterns and visual styles. I specialize in consumer products that distill complex data into simple and beautiful visualizations. With my extensive experience working in tandem with engineers, executives, and marketing teams, I know how to ensure user needs are aligned with business goals.</p>


				<h2>How volleyball made me a better designer</h2>

				<p>Playing volleyball twice a day for 8 years taught me how to make intentional decisions in complicated situations. I had to work as a team, regularly iterate through practice and understand the psychology of fellow players under intense, competitive conditions. These valuable lessons I learned on the volleyball court have carried over to the digital design work I do today.
</p>

				<h2>Things that put a smile on my face</h2>

				<p>Volleyball, skateboarding, architectural photography, strawberry ice cream and fried chicken! :)</p>
